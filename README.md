# <ins> How does console choice and game genre influence video game sales world wide, and which combinations maximise the expected revenue?

## As someone who has been playing video games most of my life it is a topic i find fascinating. I believe that by understanding the correlation between these choices would be invaluable when trying to drive sales for publishers.

## The dataset i have chosen from kaggle (VideoGame_Sales.xlsx), "provides a detailed view of video game sales, performance, critical reception, and develeper/publisher data across multiple gaming platforms"; because of this it is perfect to answer my question.
