# <ins>Q3: Pick one of the ‘research questions’ below and explore it with your dataset and neural network. </ins>
Research questions:
 1. How does data augmentation affect the performance of a neural network?
 2. How do parameters of a convolutional (or autoencoder) neural network affect 
performance of a network?
 3. How does choice of activation function affect the performance of a neural network?
 4. How does pre-training (and epochs and batches) affect the performance of a neural 
network? 
5. How do choices about data such as i) amount of training data and ii) balance of classes in a 
classification problem affect the performance of a neural network?
